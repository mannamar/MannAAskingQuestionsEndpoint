# MannAAskingQuestionsEndpoint

Project Description:
A AskingQuestions application that will take in the user's name and the time they woke up as inputs and output a string containing that information

Instructions:
1. Download the files and put them in their own folder, open the folder in VS Code, and start debugging (F5)
2. Navigate to "http://localhost:5110/AskingQuestions" for the default greeting (you may need to change the port if it's different on your system > see debug console)
3. Append URL with the name and time you woke up today (e.g. 10am. 8:30, 7 o'clock, etc) such as "http://localhost:5110/AskingQuestions/John/9am" for a customized greeting
4. Be good!

Peer reviewed by Andrew Nilsson: Good job with the default and the inputs work well on postman as well as the string that is returned.
